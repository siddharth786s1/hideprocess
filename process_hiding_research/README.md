# Process Hiding Research

This directory contains research material from other GitHub repositories that implement similar process hiding techniques.

## Repositories Analyzed

1. **HideProcessHook** - API hooking approach for hiding processes
2. **VX-API** - Advanced process manipulation and API hooking techniques
3. **AnotherProcessHollowing** - Process hollowing implementation
4. **process-hollowing** - Alternative approach to process memory manipulation

## Key Findings

- Multiple methods to hide processes in Windows
- API hooking is the most common approach
- Process hollowing provides an alternative technique
- Proper error handling and Unicode support are essential

See the main project's `RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md` for detailed analysis of the techniques used.

## Educational Purpose

This research was conducted purely for educational purposes to understand Windows internals and process management techniques.
